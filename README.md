Certainly! Let's break down the code step by step to understand how it works. I'll explain each part of the code in simpler terms.

1. **Input and Initialization**:
    - `int n;`: We declare an integer variable `n` to store the number of elements (people in line).
    - `cin >> n;`: We read the value of `n` from the standard input (keyboard).
    - `vector<int> arr(n), position(n, 0);`: We create two vectors:
        - `arr` to store the input sequence of people.
        - `position` to keep track of the positions directly behind each person (initialized with zeros).
    - `int x = 0;`: We initialize an integer variable `x` to zero. This variable will later store the starting position.

2. **Reading the Input Sequence**:
    - We use a `for` loop to read the input sequence into the `arr` vector.
    - If the current element is not `-1`, we update the `position` vector to reflect the position of that element in the sequence.
    - If the current element is `-1`, we set `x` to the current index plus one, indicating the starting position.

3. **Output the Sequence**:
    - We print the starting position (stored in `x`).
    - Then, we follow the chain of positions using a `while` loop:
        - If the next position is not zero (i.e., there's a valid successor), we print the next position and update `x` to that position.
        - We continue this process until we reach the end of the chain (when the next position is zero).

4. **End of Program**:
    - We print a newline to separate the output from other text.
    - Finally, we return 0 to indicate successful program execution.

The code assumes that there is a unique way to arrange the elements based on the given input. It uses the `position` vector to track the direct successor of each element and prints out the sequence starting from the element marked with `-1`.
